# Prototype 1:

- Making the LED matrix itself so I can test on a breadboard
- It is 16x8 and the end product will be probably around 320x160 or similar size
- I have sent the PCB off to manufacturing and will probably get it back in 2-3 days
- Next stage is to get LED driver ICs/shift registers/decade counters
